### Heart Attack Risk Prediction 🚑❤️
- This project builds a machine learning model to predict the risk of a heart attack using patient health data. The dataset includes various health metrics such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes status, and physical activity.

## 📌 Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handles missing values

- Converts categorical data to numerical (one-hot encoding)

- Standardizes numerical features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

- Distribution of key health indicators

- Correlation heatmap of features

- Class imbalance visualisation

- Class Imbalance Handling 🏗️

- Uses SMOTETomek to balance classes (oversampling & undersampling)

## Machine Learning Models 🚀

- XGBoost (Optimized with GridSearchCV)

- Random Forest (Hyperparameter Tuned)

- Performance Evaluation

- Classification Reports (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

- Confusion Matrices
